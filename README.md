# üèäThe Pool Lens

Pool Lens is a DeFi analytics platform that allows users to retrieve and analyze liquidity information from Uniswap V3 pools by entering a pool address. The platform supports seamless network selection, wallet connection, and bookmarking of frequently accessed liquidity pools.

## Features

- **Liquidity Lookup** ‚Äì Fetches and displays liquidity data for a given Uniswap V3 pool address.
- **Network Selection** ‚Äì Allows users to select a blockchain network before querying liquidity pools.
- **Wallet Connection** ‚Äì Enables seamless integration with MetaMask for transaction-related actions.

- **Search History** ‚Äì Stores the last searched pool addresses for quick access.

- In this project, I fetched liquidity data from Uniswap V3 pools using the Ethers.js library to interact with the Uniswap V3 smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By connecting to the selected network, users can input a pool address, and the application queries the contract for real-time liquidity details. To enable bookmarking, I implemented a feature that allows users to store their favorite pools on the Lisk Sepolia network by utilizing a smart contract. This ensures that bookmarked pools remain accessible even across sessions..
